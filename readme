# Telecom Data Analyzer - User Guide

## Overview

The Telecom Data Analyzer is a browser-based tool for analyzing and visualizing telecom data files. It supports various file formats including CSV and Excel, and can automatically detect and process different types of telecom data such as call records, text messages, device information, and data sessions.

## Getting Started

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. The interface is divided into two main tabs: "Data Viewer" and "Data Type Configuration".

## File Upload and Processing

1. In the "Data Viewer" tab, locate the "Upload Files" section.
2. Click "Browse" to select your telecom data files (CSV or Excel format).
3. You can select multiple files at once.
4. By default, the application will auto-detect file types, but you can also select a specific file type from the dropdown if needed.
5. Click "Process Files" to load and analyze the data.

## Data Types and Automatic Detection

The application automatically detects these data types:
- Call Records
- Text/MMS Messages
- Device Information
- Account Information
- Payment Records
- Data Session Records

If a file type is unknown, you can create a custom type definition by clicking the "Create Custom Type" button that appears.

## Name Mapping

The Name Mapping feature allows you to assign readable names to phone numbers:

1. Enter a phone number in the "Phone Number" field.
2. Enter a name in the "Assign Name" field.
3. Click "Assign Name" to create the mapping.
4. Names will appear in the data display instead of numbers.
5. You can export your name mappings using "Export Name Mapping CSV" and import them later.

## Searching and Filtering

### Basic Search
- Use the search box at the top to perform a text search across all fields.

### Advanced Filtering
1. Select a data type from the "All Data Types" dropdown.
2. Each data type has specific filters available:
   - **Call Records**: Filter by date range, duration, tower ID, call direction, phone numbers, etc.
   - **Text/MMS Messages**: Filter by date, message type, direction, content, sender/recipient.
   - **Device Information**: Filter by device ID, type, manufacturer.
   - **Data Sessions**: Filter by date, tower/cell ID, duration, IP addresses, technology, data volume, port allocation time.
3. Click "Apply Filters" to filter the data based on your criteria.
4. Click "Reset" to clear all filters.

### Dynamic Filters
- For fields found in the data but not predefined in the system, the application creates "Additional Fields Filters" automatically.
- These allow you to filter by any field present in your data.

## Data Visualization

1. Data is displayed in a table format with pagination (100 records per page).
2. Click on column headers to sort by that column.
3. For call records, you can check "Group by Phone" to aggregate towers and locations.
4. Additional fields discovered in the data are highlighted with a light background in the table.

## Exporting Data

- Click "Export Filtered CSV" to download the current filtered dataset as a CSV file.

## Data Type Configuration

To customize or create new data types:

1. Go to the "Data Type Configuration" tab.
2. Select an existing data type to edit or choose "Create New Data Type".
3. Define the data type name and identifier pattern (used for auto-detection).
4. Add field definitions by clicking "Add Field":
   - **Display Name**: How the field appears in the UI
   - **Possible column names**: Comma-separated list of possible column headers for this field
   - **Field Type**: Text, Number, Date, or Boolean
5. Click "Save" to save your data type definition.

You can also:
- Export all data type definitions to a JSON file
- Import data type definitions from a JSON file
- Delete custom data type definitions

## Performance Optimization

For large datasets:
1. The application uses chunked processing to handle large files efficiently.
2. Table data is paginated to improve rendering performance.
3. For very large Excel files (>10MB), data is processed in batches.
4. When working with files containing thousands of records, filtering is recommended before analyzing.

## Tips for Best Performance

1. Use specific filters to reduce the dataset size before analysis.
2. Close other browser tabs when processing very large files.
3. For Excel files with more than 10,000 rows, consider splitting into smaller files for better performance.
4. Wait for the loading indicator to disappear before interacting with the application.
